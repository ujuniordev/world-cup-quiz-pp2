# World Cup Quiz
## Project Portfolio 2
Are you a football fan? Would you like to test your knowledge about the FIFA World Cup? If your answer is yes, try this quiz I have just made. The quiz contains a couple of questions about the World Cup editions and in the end, it will display your score.

## User experience

The main goal of the project was to have a clean page, with a fluid experience for the user.
The user stories that were used to develop the website are listed below:

 - **US 01 Header**
As a user, I want to have a website logo so that I understand what the website is for.
 - **US 02 Question counter**
As a user, I want to have a list of question numbers so that I understand how many questions the quiz has and follow my progress.
 - **US 03 Questions & answers**
As a user, I want to visualize the questions so that I am able to answer them.
As a user, I want to visualize the options so that I can choose the right answers.
 - **US 04 Start/Restart/Play again button**
As a user, I want to visualize a Start/Restart/Play again button so that I can start or restart the quiz.

## Features

This website contains the following features/pages that were developed considering the user's stories listed in the section User experience above, they should all have responsive behavior allowing navigation on any device:
 - **F1 Header (using US01)**
The header is composed of 1 main element: the logo in simple text and the main goal is to inform the user of the purpose of the page.
 - **F2 Question counter (using US02)**
The question counter lists the total number of questions in the quiz, with the goal of informing the user of his progress. The question counter also displays the correct and incorrect answers by using background color. No action happens when the user clicks on the question numbers.
 - **F3 Questions & answers (using US3)**
This block is straightforward and it brings to the user the questions about the World Cup and 4 options for each question.
 - **F4 Start/Restart/Play again button (using US4)**
When pressing the button Start/Restart/Play again the user is redirected to the beginning of the game and can play again.

## Design

The following design choices were made: clean and simple fonts & color palettes, but since the main goal of this page is to be playful, a background image was included with the World Cup cup & the use of Bootstrap was included to add colors to the buttons.
